# RQML Agent Guidelines

## Strictness: `standard`

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `relaxed` | Prototyping. Spec is advisory. Quick iteration allowed. |
| `standard` | Production default. Spec-first for features. Core traces. |
| `strict` | Full traceability. All behavior specified. No ghost features. |
| `certified` | Regulated/safety-critical. Audit-grade traces with metadata. |

This project uses **RQML** as the single source of truth for system intent. Familiarize yourself with the documentation at https://rqml.org/docs/user-guide/ and the development process at https://rqml.org/docs/development-process/

**Specification file:** A specification lives in a single `.rqml` file (convention: `requirements.rqml`) in a project's own directory, alongside a `.rqml/` directory. A monorepo may hold several — one per project. A spec governs its own directory and all of its **subdirectories**, but never a **parent directory**; where one spec's directory is itself a subdirectory of another's, the nearer spec governs that subdirectory. The governing spec for any file is the **nearest enclosing** one, found by checking its directory and then each parent directory. Cross-spec references are made only through trace edges with document locators, never by where spec files are placed. See https://rqml.org/docs/monorepo.

This repository's governing spec is `requirements.rqml` at the repository root; it governs `extension/`, `docs/` and everything else here.

**Schema file:**
This project is on RQML **2.2.0**; the schema is at https://rqml.org/schema/rqml-2.2.0.xsd. Adhere to it at all times and follow the guidance in its comments. Use as much of the RQML tagset as is needed to capture high-quality requirements.

Note the 2.2.0 trace form: an edge carries its endpoints as `from`/`to` attributes — a bare id for a local target, `rqml:<doc-uri>#<id>` for another document, any other scheme URI or relative path for an external artifact. The nested `<locator>` form belongs to 2.1.0 and earlier (see ADR-0010).

## Toolchain

The spec-first loop is enforced by the `rqml` CLI (npm: `@rqml/cli`; the `@rqml/mcp` server exposes the same engine as agent tools):

```bash
rqml check                 # deterministic gate: validation + coverage + drift (exit 0 = pass)
rqml status                # re-anchor: spec, coverage, and drift state
rqml show <REQ-ID>         # one requirement: statement, acceptance criteria, trace neighborhood
rqml impact <ID>           # what is affected, transitively, if this artifact changes
rqml overview              # readable projection of the spec (--section/--id to scope)
rqml matrix                # traceability matrix: status, goals, code, tests, coverage gaps
rqml link <REQ-ID> <path>  # record an implements edge + drift baseline (--type verifiedBy for tests)
rqml approve <REQ-ID>      # transition a requirement's status (default approved)
rqml gate                  # block implementation of non-approved requirements
rqml skeleton <kind>       # schema-valid snippet: req | edge | testCase | stateMachine
```

Run `rqml status` when you start a session to re-anchor on the spec. Run `rqml check` before finishing any task — it must exit 0.

**Enforcement boundary.** Do not treat the absence of a pre-edit block as approval. The `PreToolUse` approval gate is best-effort — it fires only for certain edit tools, so a write made another way (a `Bash` redirect like `> file` or `tee`, `sed -i`, a notebook edit, or an MCP file writer) is not seen by it, and even when it fires it only blocks edits to code already linked to a non-approved requirement. The authoritative gate is the turn-end `rqml check` (the `Stop` hook) plus CI — and because the `Stop` gate itself fails open when the CLI is missing, CI is the unconditional backstop. Follow approval-before-implementation yourself: only implement `status="approved"` requirements, and make sure `rqml check` exits 0 before you finish.

## Core Principle: Spec-First Development

Code follows specification, not the reverse. If code and spec diverge, the spec is authoritative—update the code or negotiate a spec change with the developer.

RQML organizes work into a **five-stage process** (https://rqml.org/docs/development-process/). Each stage produces a durable artifact in version control; verification feeds back to the spec, so it is a loop:

| Stage | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Spec** | Capture intent as requirements | `requirements.rqml` |
| **Design** | Decide architecture, record decisions | ADRs in `.rqml/adr/` |
| **Plan** | Break work into agent-sized stages | `.rqml/plan.md` |
| **Code** | Implement specified behavior, keep traces current | code + tests |
| **Verify** | Prove coverage and catch drift | trace graph + `rqml check` |

Never skip ahead: do not implement behavior that is not specified, and do not make a significant architectural choice without recording it as an ADR.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Spec
Ask clarifying questions until you understand the goal, scope, acceptance criteria, and constraints. Don't assume—capture assumptions as `<notes>` or `<issue>` elements. **Never implement unspecified behavior.** Update the `.rqml` file before coding:
- Add a `<req>` with statement and acceptance criteria
- Set appropriate `type`, `priority`, and `status="draft"`
- Get developer confirmation; only `status="approved"` requirements drive implementation

### 2. Design
Before building, decide *how*. Record each significant architectural decision as an **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** in `.rqml/adr/`, following the canonical format (https://rqml.org/docs/development-process/design): `NNNN-kebab-case-slug.md`, with Status, Classification, Context, Options considered, Decision, and Consequences. A decision is ADR-worthy when there are real alternatives or the choice constrains future work; skip ADRs for low-level implementation details. ADRs are immutable once accepted—supersede, don't edit.

### 3. Plan
Break approved requirements into a staged implementation plan at `.rqml/plan.md`, framed for coding agents: each stage names its goal, the requirement IDs it addresses, the files it touches, and how to verify it.

### 4. Code (Implement)
Read the requirement first: `rqml show REQ-XXX`. Check blast radius before changing existing artifacts: `rqml impact REQ-XXX`. Honor the ADRs. If you discover missing requirements, stop and add them to the spec first. After implementing, record the trace link:

```bash
rqml link REQ-XXX src/path/to/implementation.ts
```

### 5. Verify
Add tests that reference requirement IDs, then record verification and run the gate:

```bash
rqml link REQ-XXX test/path/to/test.ts --type verifiedBy
rqml check   # must exit 0 before you are done
```

## When Code and Spec Diverge

1. **Spec gap** (code has behavior not in spec): Propose adding the requirement, mark as `status="review"`
2. **Code bug** (code doesn't match spec): Fix the code
3. **Spec bug** (spec is wrong): Propose correction, wait for developer confirmation

**Never silently change the spec to match code.**

| Aspect | relaxed | standard | strict | certified |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Spec (elicitation) | Major features | Testable reqs | Edge cases | Formal |

## Change Summary Template

For PRs and commits:

```
## RQML Trace Summary

**Requirements:** REQ-xxx (added/modified/implemented)
**Design:** ADR-xxxx — decision recorded (if any)
**Implementation:** `path/to/file` — what changed
**Verification:** `path/to/test` — what it verifies
**Open items:** gaps, assumptions, follow-ups
```

---

## Schema Validation

The `.rqml` file must remain valid XML conforming to the version of RQML referenced in the version attribute in the spec document.

**To validate:** Use the toolchain — it validates offline against the bundled schema and also checks referential integrity the XSD alone cannot enforce:
```bash
rqml validate
```

If the `rqml` CLI is not installed, `npx @rqml/cli validate` works without installation. As a last resort, xmllint (pre-installed on macOS/Linux) checks XSD validity only:
```bash
xmllint --schema https://rqml.org/schema/rqml-2.2.0.xsd <rqml-file-name> --noout
```

**IDE validation:** If the `.rqml` file includes `xsi:schemaLocation`, XML-aware editors (VS Code with XML extension, IntelliJ) validate automatically.

The schema comments contain detailed guidance on document structure, ID conventions, and requirement quality criteria.

**If unsure:** Ask the developer before making structural changes to the spec.
